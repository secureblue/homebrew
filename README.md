# Homebrew
[![homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=blue&label=homebrew&query=builds.latest.source_package.version&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcopr.fedorainfracloud.org%2Fapi_3%2Fpackage%3Fownername%3Dsecureblue%26projectname%3Dpackages%26packagename%3Dhomebrew%26with_latest_build%3DTrue)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/secureblue/packages/package/homebrew/)

This repository packages [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Linux as an RPM
package.

The RPM package sets up a Homebrew installation in `/usr/share/homebrew`. To
minimize deviation from the official install script, this installation is
produced at build-time using a version of the install script that's been patched
to use a different installation prefix and to omit steps that should wait until
after installation (such as setting up the Homebrew cache and running
`brew update`).

If Homebrew has not already been set up on the user's system, a systemd service
then copies this installation to `/home/linuxbrew` and transfers ownership of it
to UID 1000. The package also sets up systemd services to automatically update
Homebrew, as well as shell completions for the bash and fish shells.
